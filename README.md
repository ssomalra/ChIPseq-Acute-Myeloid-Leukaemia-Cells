# ChIP-seq Pipeline 
This repository contains the code and documentation for a ChIP-seq pipeline that I used for training and understanding the ChIP-seq analysis workflow. The pipeline incorporates various tools and steps to process and analyze ChIP-seq data.

## Overview
ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing) is a widely used  technique for studying protein-DNA interactions and identifying locations on the genome that are bound by a protein of interest. This project aims to provide a comprehensive ChIP-seq pipeline that can be used as a reference for understanding the analysis steps involved. The steps and tools involved in this pipeline are described below.

## Pipeline Summary

## Data Source
The ChIP-seq data used in this project was downloaded from the NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA727828). The dataset consists of ChIP-seq data collected from THP-1 cells, which are human leukemia cells. The following files were downloaded from NCBI:
- Control Samples: SRR18643804 and SRR14458872
- Treatment Samples: SRR14458865 and SRR14458869

*Note: The provided data serves as an example dataset for training purposes and understanding the pipeline.
